## How to Use:
Refer to [these instructions](https://github.com/Touchcreator/TAPL/blob/main/README.md#how-to-use).
Please note that `{<code>}` now runs Lua code instead of Python code.
Also note that you need the build, in releases.

## Notes:
Currently very limited.

Right now, you can perform basic math functions like `/`, `*`, `+`, and `-` and register strings and numbers (only integers).

Please note that `/` performs integer division.

## Remarks
Suprisingly the binary size is only ~192~ 573 kilobytes, compared to TAPL's around 6 MB.
